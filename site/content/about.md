## Intro 
Hello and welcome to my site / blog!
This is a place for me to put up anything and everything that interests me!
I am aiming to make blog posts on technical topics that I find interesting, probably in the area of statistics (but I guess we'll see).

Here are some topics that interest me:

* _Probabilistic Modelling_. I am fascinated with the idea of developing bespoke probabilistic models that try and cleverly capture some latent aspect of a phenomenon.
  Here are some of my favourites ( [A](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8OYE6iEAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=8OYE6iEAAAAJ:L24QuVWYgZ0C) [B](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8OYE6iEAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=8OYE6iEAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC) [C](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-13/issue-1/Dynamics-of-homelessness-in-urban-America/10.1214/18-AOAS1200.full) ).
* _Bayesian computation_. My Data Science masters thesis involved developing a sequential monte carlo method to perform fast bayesian variable selection in generalized linear models.
  In addition to that, I am hoping to soon make a contribution to the [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) sampling library.
* _The Nix package manager and ecosystem_. I find the idea of building a configuration with strong reproducibility guarantees very powerful and satisfying.
  This site itself is built with Nix! (Very much inspired by [this](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/jdisaacs.com) excellent repo)
